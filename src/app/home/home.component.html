        This application was automatically generated with
        <a target="_blank" href="https://aista.com/">Aista Magic Cloud</a>.
        It features easy translation into your language(s) of choice, and
        provides a default starter-kit for your CRUD apps. Feel free to modify this page as you see fit.
        Notice, to create <em>"an app"</em> out of this website, just click the bookmark button on your phone,
        and choose <em>"Add to home screen"</em>, and it will behave more or less exactly like a native app,
        as long as the user has an internet connection. In the <em>"helpers"</em> folder you can find several
        helper components, allowing you to change any aspect of your entity fields, to for instance provide
        file upload, image capturing, etc. These are as follows
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>magic-autocomplete</strong> - Helps you when creating new entities when a field in your entity is referencing another field in another table. Useful for larger datasets.</li>
        <li><strong>magic-file</strong> - Helps you when creating new entities when a field in your entity should be wrapping a file physically on disc in your backend, as in uploading files and associate these with data entities.</li>
        <li><strong>magic-file-view</strong> - Helps you when viewing an entity and downloading an associated file when a field is wrapping a physical file.</li>
        <li><strong>magic-filter</strong> - Helps you create filtering controls when a field in an item is referencing another field in another table.</li>
        <li><strong>magic-image</strong> - Same as the magic-file, except it allows you to upload images specifically, and will automatically resize your images if you want it to.</li>
        <li><strong>magic-image-view</strong> - The equivalent of the magic-file component, except it will display images inline on your form.</li>
        <li><strong>magic-selector</strong> - The same as magic-autocomplete but will create a select dropdown list instead of an autocompleter and hence is more useful for smaller datasets.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        All of the above custom components are fairly well documented in the TypeScript files, and you can easily include them 
        as you see fit in your own applications. Besides from the above special components, everything in this template is
        plain and standard Angular components, besides the occasional 3rd party component, used to for instance allow
        the user to pick a date and time, etc. The latter are open source libraries you can find documentation for if
        you search for your component's name.
